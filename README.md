React Memory Game

Friends Clicky Game is a memory game, which consists on saving the user’s clicks of different Friends cards. 

The user has to remember which card was clicked and not click it again. If the user clicks it again, the user loses and the game resets by randomly shuffling the friends cards. 

A top score is saved for the user’s best performance. Once the user reaches a score of twelve, a “You win” message appears.
